## Refinement Plan & Code Review

**Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

For this category, I have chosen to revisit the CS-330 Final Project from the Computational Graphics and Visualization course. This course utilized C++ and OpenGL. I created a scene which comprised of a school setting, complete with a desk, chair, books, plane, cylinder, and a globe. For my enhancement to this artifact, I would like to add a chalk board with a stand to my scene. I wanted to add these features when I was taking the course, but I ran out of time and was never able to implement it. I will need to create the geometry necessary to render the chalk board with the stand. I will also need to create a new Vertex Buffer Object (VBO), and texture coordinates for this addition. Finally, I will need to create and render this new primitive in the main while loop in the code.

**Enhancement Two: Data Structures and Algorithms**

For this category, I have chosen to revisit the IT-145 Final Project from the Foundations in App Development course. This was a relatively simple project written in the Java programming language. The application name is the ZooMonitoringSysyem.java. The original version of this program uses two text files for user interaction. One file is called Amimals.txt and the other file is called Habitat.txt. The program asks the user to choose what they would like to monitor: Animal or Habitat. Based on the user’s selection, another menu is displayed that asks the user to make a selection from the options contained in either the Animal or Habitat text file. The code displays a warning prompt to the user if less-than desirable conditions exist. For my enhancement to this artifact, I would like to add two more animals and habitats as user options. In addition, I would like to add images for the different animals inside a prompt that pops up when a user selects that animal. 

**Enhancement Three: Databases**

For this category, I have chosen to revisit DAT-220 Fundamentals of Data Mining. This course utilized JMP Pro 15 as a means to manipulate big data stored in .jmp files. This manipulation included finding patterns in the data according to pre-defined parameters and search options. While the JMP software itself is not modifiable, for my enhancement to this artifact, I would like to automate JMP using the C# programming language to create a .jmp data table file. I am a little concerned about figuring out how to perform this enhancement. When I researched this online it looks pretty tricky to incorporate. I may have to modify this enhancement as time goes on, or select a different enhancement to implement. 

Update:

I decided to abandon the original approach as described above. I decided to use Microsoft SQL Server Management Suite (SSMS) instead of JMP. I still used C# as the database client to interface with the SSMS database. JMP is not free and I had no way of accessing my past course content through the schools’ virtual learning environment.
