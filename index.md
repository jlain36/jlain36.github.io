# CS-499 ePortfolio

## Introduction

I will start by saying this program was certainly not easy. It takes a lot of passion, dedication, and sacrifice to successfully complete the course requirements for this degree. While I’ve learned so many important concepts and skills throughout this program, the most important skill I’ve learned is perseverance. It is difficult to struggle with a course, but through hard work and perseverance I have learned that anything is possible with the right attitude and mindset. There is no greater feeling than succeeding when challenged by a seemingly impossible tasking. 

Another skill that I feel is essential in the field of Computer Science is the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. This program taught me the inner-workings and architecture of OOP. The Agile framework, the Software Development Lifecycle, and programming in several languages are other skills I have attained through this program of study. 

The creation of this portfolio, and the artifacts contained herein, successfully demonstrates my ability to work in a collaborative and team environment. My artifacts are publicly available through GitHub. I sincerely hope others will take what I have created and expand upon them. Additionally, my Software Design and Engineering skills are showcased via my code enhancements for Enhancement One. The newly added features for Enhancement One clearly demonstrate my expertise in Software Design and Engineering. 

The Enhancement Two code enhancements showcase my ability and skills utilizing Data Structures and algorithms efficiently and effectively using the best practices taught throughout this program. Enhancement Three was my own concept of creating a database. This clearly shows that I am able to think outside of the box using my skills to create a new project from a conceptual idea to a finished, polished artifact. All three of my portfolio artifact enhancements demonstrate my ability to implement security within my code. This is evident with the addition of login credentials for accessing the code.       

## Portfolio Summary

This portfolio shines light on my competence and skills within Computer Science. The first enhancement in my portfolio showcases my strengths in Software Design and Engineering. Enhancement One exemplifies my advanced knowledge and skills with the design of a computer graphics program. This program required the advanced knowledge of C++, OpenGL, and Software Design and Engineering. 

Enhancement Two showcases my skills with implementing and modifying the select case Data Structure within the Java programming language for a Zoo Monitoring System program. Enhancement Two exemplifies my knowledge and expertise of manipulating a Data Structure utilizing a menu driven Algorithm. 

Enhancement Three was not an enhancement. It is a new program demonstrating my ingenuity and skills with creating a school database project using the C# programming language and Microsoft SQL Server Management Suite. I created a database client using C#. I learned C# specifically for this project. This project demonstrates my ability to learn a new programming language quickly and integrate it with an existing database management system.
