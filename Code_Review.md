## Refinement Plan & Code Review

**Enhancement One: Software Engineering/Design**

For this category, I have chosen to revisit the CS-330 Final Project from the Computational Graphics and Visualization course. This course utilized C++ and OpenGL. I created a scene which comprised of a school setting, complete with a desk, chair, books, plane, cylinder, and a globe. For my enhancement to this artifact, I would like to add a chalk board with a stand to my scene. I wanted to add these features when I was taking the course, but I ran out of time and was never able to implement it. I will need to create the geometry necessary to render the chalk board with the stand. I will also need to create a new Vertex Buffer Object (VBO), and texture coordinates for this addition. Finally, I will need to create and render this new primitive in the main while loop in the code.

**Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

For this category, I have chosen to revisit the IT-145 Final Project from the Foundations in App Development course. This was a relatively simple project written in the Java programming language. The application name is the ZooMonitoringSysyem.java. The original version of this program uses two text files for user interaction. One file is called Amimals.txt and the other file is called Habitat.txt. The program asks the user to choose what they would like to monitor: Animal or Habitat. Based on the userâ€™s selection, another menu is displayed that asks the user to make a selection from the options contained in either the Animal or Habitat text file. The code displays a warning prompt to the user if less-than desirable conditions exist. For my enhancement to this artifact, I would like to add two more animals and habitats as user options. In addition, I would like to add images for the different animals inside a prompt that pops up when a user selects that animal. 

**Enhancement Three: Databases**
